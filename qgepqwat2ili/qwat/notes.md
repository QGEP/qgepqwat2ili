## Questions
* druck vs druckzone ? are they both pressure values

## Opportunities for QWAT
* add consommation


## Remarks for export

### Nodes
* Geometries are transformed to 2056. With older versions of proj on the system, this will lead to a not precise transformation (if the grid is missing).
* Consommation is not available in QWAT
* Pression cannot be taken at the node level

### Hydrant
* no diameter/dimensions in QWAT
* sprinkler should be in hydrant?
