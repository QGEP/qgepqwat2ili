## General / Opportunities for QWAT
* add consommation
* units are often not explicit
* add SIA 405 values in value lists
* notion of owner / distributor|actor / operator

## value lists
* translations to german are missing

## Tables

### Pipes
* protection needs to be normalized
* rugosity no defined
* relining is missing

### Nodes
* Geometries are transformed to 2056. With older versions of proj on the system, this will lead to a not precise transformation (if the grid is missing).
* Consommation is not available in QWAT
* Pression cannot be taken at the node level

### Hydrant
* no diameter/dimensions in QWAT
* sprinkler should be in hydrant?



## Questions
* druck vs druckzone ? are they both pressure values
